# WebUI Quickstart Starter Template

This project is a barebone template used when installing the Quickstart Entando tutorial.

At the end of the day it's an opinionated [Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12) app!

It has out of the box integration with App Builder and Entando Core APIs but allows Developers to have much more control over the deployed code. **It's Low Code meets Pro Code!**

Check the [Entando WebUI](https://github.com/entando/entando-webui) documentation for more details regarding the project Architecture.

### Code Style

We propose a basic ESLint and Prettier configuration but feel free to edit and configure according to your own needs.

To check code style just run:
```
yarn lint
```

### Tests

We provide basic tests using Jest to demo how to assure QA best practices for your Pages and Components.

For more details check the `tests` folder.

To run all test suites and validate code coverage just run:
